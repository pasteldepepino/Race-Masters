There are two versions:
Normal version: Uses emojis for the cars but will only work on terminals that support emojis.
Pure ASCII version: this version has no emojis, your car is a "O" and enemy cars are "X" use this version if your terminal doesn't support emojis.

It's simple to play, just download the file that you want, and run it with '$ bash race_masters.bash' or '$ bash race_masters_ascii.bash'.
